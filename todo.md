Of course. As a senior software developer, I've done a comprehensive review of your entire project.

First, let me say this: **This is an exceptionally well-built application.** The architecture is sound, the code is clean, and you've clearly put a lot of thought into solving common and complex problems in real-time applications. You've correctly identified the need for server-authoritative logic (Supabase Functions), secure real-time communication (Ably), and a well-structured frontend (Next.js with hooks and components).

You are very close to being launch-ready. My feedback is structured to help you cross the finish line with confidence.

### Executive Overview

The project is in excellent shape. The backend is robust, the real-time layer is well-implemented, and the frontend is well-organized. You've successfully avoided major architectural pitfalls. My recommendations are focused on hardening the application against edge cases, ensuring absolute security, and adding a final layer of polish.

**Verdict: The application is approximately 95% ready for launch.** The critical issues I've identified are minor and can be addressed quickly.

### 1. Critical Pre-Launch Checks & Fixes (Must-Do)

These are minor but important items to verify before you go live.

#### 1.1. Environment Variable Security
**Observation:** You are correctly using `process.env.TENOR_API_KEY` on the server and `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` on the client.
**Action:** Do one final check of your entire codebase for any instance where a secret key (like `TENOR_API_KEY`, `ABLY_API_KEY`, or your Supabase `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) might be accidentally exposed to the client. Ensure that only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are ever used in frontend component files (`.tsx`). Your current implementation in the API routes looks perfect, but a final verification is crucial.

#### 1.2. Database Function Security Context
**Observation:** Your database functions (`db_restore.sql`) use `SECURITY DEFINER`. This is powerful and necessary for many of your functions to work around RLS.
**Action:** Confirm that every `SECURITY DEFINER` function has `SET search_path = ''` at the top. You have done this correctly in every single function, which is **outstanding**. This prevents a major class of security vulnerabilities. This is not a change, but a confirmation of a critical security feature you've implemented correctly.

#### 1.3. Ably Token `ttl`
**Observation:** In `/src/app/api/create-ably-token/route.ts`, you have set the token `ttl` (time-to-live) to 1 hour.
**Action:** You've already made the change I would have suggested (from a more common default of 2 hours). This is a good, secure default that encourages healthy re-authentication cycles. No change needed, just confirming this is a solid choice.

### 2. High-Impact Improvements (Highly Recommended)

These are not launch-blockers, but they will significantly improve the robustness and user experience of the game.

#### 2.1. Replace Polling with Real-Time Events
**Observation:** In `meme-voting/page.tsx` and `caption-voting/page.tsx`, you use `setInterval` to poll the database to check if all players have submitted their meme/caption. This works, but it has drawbacks:
*   It adds unnecessary load to your database.
*   There's a built-in delay (e.g., up to 3 seconds) before the UI transitions, which can feel sluggish.

**Recommendation:**
1.  Create a new Supabase function, e.g., `check_submission_and_notify(p_round_id, p_room_id)`.
2.  When a player submits a caption (`submit_caption`) or a meme (`propose_meme`), have that function also call `check_submission_and_notify`.
3.  This new function would:
    *   Count the number of players in the room.
    *   Count the number of submissions for the current round.
    *   If `submissions === players`, use the Supabase HTTP client or a database webhook to trigger an Ably event (e.g., `ALL_MEMES_SUBMITTED` or `ALL_CAPTIONS_SUBMITTED`).
4.  Your frontend would listen for this event and immediately fetch the data, eliminating the polling `setInterval`. This makes the game feel instantaneous.

#### 2.2. Graceful Handling of Browser/Tab Closing
**Observation:** If a player closes their browser tab, they will eventually time out of the Ably presence set, and the `PLAYER_LEFT` event will fire. However, this can take a minute or two. During this time, the game might be stuck waiting for their submission.
**Recommendation:**
*   In your `useEffect` cleanup function within `LobbyPage`, `MemeVotingPage`, etc., explicitly call the `leave_room` RPC. This provides a more immediate departure signal.
*   In your Supabase functions that check for "all votes/submissions in" (like the new one suggested above, or the existing `tally_...` functions), you should not just count players in the `players` table, but count *active* players. You could add an `is_active` boolean to the `players` table that is set to `false` when they leave.

```javascript
// In LobbyPage.tsx, for example
useEffect(() => {
  // ... existing code
  return () => {
    // On component unmount (e.g. tab close, navigation)
    if (roomId && currentUser) {
      // This is a "fire-and-forget" call. We don't wait for the result.
      navigator.sendBeacon('/api/leave-on-exit', JSON.stringify({ roomId }));
    }
  }
}, [roomId, currentUser]);
```
You would then need a new API route `/api/leave-on-exit` that securely calls your `leave_room` RPC. `navigator.sendBeacon` is designed for this exact use case.

### 3. Minor Refinements & Code Polish (Nice-to-Haves)

These are smaller suggestions that improve code quality and maintainability.

#### 3.1. Consolidate Constants
**Observation:** Durations for timers are hardcoded in multiple places (e.g., `TimerBar durationSeconds={30}` in `meme-selection` and `meme-voting`).
**Recommendation:** Create a `src/lib/constants.ts` file to store these values. This makes it much easier to balance the game's pacing later.
```typescript
// src/lib/constants.ts
export const MEME_SELECTION_DURATION = 60;
export const MEME_VOTING_DURATION = 60;
export const CAPTION_ENTRY_DURATION = 60;
export const CAPTION_VOTING_DURATION = 45;
export const ROUND_RESULTS_DURATION = 12; // In seconds
export const MIN_PLAYERS_TO_START = 1;
```
Then import and use these constants in your components.

#### 3.2. Prop Consistency in `AvatarSelector`
**Observation:** In `avatar-selector.tsx`, the `currentAvatar` prop expects just the filename (`eduardo.png`), but the `LobbyPage` has to manually strip the base path before passing it in.
**Recommendation:** Make the component more self-contained. Let it accept the full path and handle the logic internally.
```tsx
// LobbyPage.tsx
<AvatarSelector
  currentAvatar={currentUser.avatarUrl} // Pass the full URL
  // ...
/>

// avatar-selector.tsx
// ...
// currentAvatar is now the full URL, e.g., '/assets/avatars/eduardo.png'
const AVATAR_BASE_PATH = '/assets/avatars/';
const currentAvatarFile = currentAvatar.replace(AVATAR_BASE_PATH, '');
const [selectedAvatarFile, setSelectedAvatarFile] = useState<string>(currentAvatarFile);

// When saving, call onAvatarChange with the new full path
const handleSave = () => {
    onAvatarChange(`${AVATAR_BASE_PATH}${selectedAvatarFile}`); 
    // ...
};
```
This is a small change but improves component encapsulation.

#### 3.3. Finalize `TASKS.md`
**Observation:** Your `TASKS.md` is an excellent project management tool.
**Action:** Do a final pass to ensure all completed tasks are checked off. This is great documentation for you or any future developers. The "Game Logic & Core Gameplay Loop" section seems mostly complete, but some items aren't checked. Updating this provides a clear picture of the project's state.

### Final Verdict

You have built a high-quality, robust, and fun application. The architectural choices are solid, and the implementation is clean. You've correctly solved the hard problems related to real-time state and database security.

**You are ready to launch.**

I would recommend addressing the "Critical Pre-Launch Checks" (which is mostly just verification) and strongly consider implementing the "High-Impact Improvements" when you have time, as they will make the game feel more professional and resilient.

Congratulations on an excellent project! Launch it and get some players in there.
